# Lotto

In this example, we have two classes:
- `LotteryCard` represents a lottery card with 10 random quick picks
- `LotteryDrawing` represents a lottery drawing with winning numbers. The program generates a lottery card, draws winning numbers, and checks if the card has any winning numbers.

## Spec
- Your own Ruby class (with an initialize method)
- Attributes for an instance variable (eg use @ with attr_accessor, attr_writer, attr_reader, and/or your own custom getters/setters)
- Accept user input from the terminal
  - `gets`
  - `chomp`
